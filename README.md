**MultiCoder is a multi-agent collaborative code editor based on Cline. It leverages a team of AI agents, including a Planner, a Coder, and a Tester, to autonomously understand requirements, write code, and verify the results.**

## ü§ñ How it Works

MultiCoder introduces a structured, multi-agent workflow to tackle development tasks. The process is orchestrated by a central **Planner Agent**:

1.  **Analyze & Plan:** The Planner Agent receives a user's request, analyzes the requirements, and breaks the task down into a detailed plan.
2.  **Delegate:** It then delegates specific coding tasks to a dedicated **Coder Agent** and testing tasks to a **Tester Agent**.
3.  **Execute & Report:** The Coder and Tester agents work on their assigned tasks and report their progress and results back to the Planner.
4.  **Synthesize & Complete:** The Planner oversees the entire process, synthesizes the results, and presents the final solution to the user.

This collaborative approach allows MultiCoder to handle complex, multi-step tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Utilizes specialized agents (Planner, Coder, Tester) for a clear separation of concerns and more robust task execution.
*   **Automated Task Decomposition:** The Planner agent can break down high-level user requests into concrete, actionable steps.
*   **Intelligent Tool Usage:** Agents are equipped with a variety of tools to interact with the file system, run terminal commands, and search for information.
*   **Extensible and Configurable:** Built on the solid foundation of Cline, allowing for extensive configuration and the addition of new capabilities.
*   **Interactive Workflow:** While the agents work autonomously, you are always in control and can provide feedback or clarification when needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

*Installation and setup instructions will go here. For now, this is based on the original Cline extension.*

1.  Install the **MultiCoder** extension from the VS Code Marketplace (link to be added).
2.  Open the MultiCoder sidebar in VS Code.
3.  Start your first task by describing what you want to achieve.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure MultiCoder's behavior through the VS Code settings. Many options are inherited from Cline:

*   `cline.preferredLanguage`: Set the language for communication with the agent.
*   `cline.enableCheckpoints`: Enable or disable workspace checkpoints (uses `git`).
*   `cline.disableBrowserTool`: Disable the browser tool.
*   And more...

Check the extension settings in VS Code for a full list of configurable options.
